Should
I get the laundry going first?
Hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel. I'm going to do a Sunday reset
because I've been holding off a lot of
cleaning. It's time to get everything
cleaned up so I can just relax for the
rest of the day. So, yeah, let's get on
with it, shall we?
It is a mess in here.
I cook most of my meals, so the stove
area gets so messy so fast. Now I use my
Dawn soap.
Remove everything.
I don't know what you call this sponge,
but I got it from Korea. I'm sure you
can find it on Amazon to pick up the
water. Look at that. Isn't that so good?
Just go over it one more time. My
surface spray.
And then it's nice and clean. Ta. Nice
and clean.
My refrigerator is completely empty now.
All
right, that's my empty refrigerator. Got
to go get groceries. What are you doing
hogging up all the pillows?
Ow.
Ow. All of that.
I hope you guys enjoyed some of those
POV shots earlier in the video. They
were filmed using the Insta 360 Go
Ultra. If you ever wanted to start
vlogging, but you were too shy to film
in public, this is literally the camera
for you. I just love small cameras like
this that are discreet. Fits in your
pocket. This flips out so you can see
yourself vlogging. Or you can also take
this part off, which is the action pod,
and it's even smaller. It is literally
smaller than the palm of my hands. This
is also magnetic, so you can attach it
to any magnetic surface. It films in 4K,
so you get really good, high quality
footage. And I love the little
accessories that it comes with so you
can get even more unique POV angle
shots. This is a necklace that you just
wear around your neck. You just tuck it
under my shirt. This is a magnetic
necklace so it just attaches. Will you
look at that? So you can get like really
cool hands-free POV shots. I also love
this little hat clip that you can attach
to your hat. And then boom. There's also
a ring that you can just click to start
recording. This is one of my favorite
accessories. is the pivot stand mount.
It has like a little adhesive you can
attach to any surface. It has this ball
so you can literally rotate your camera
at any angle. There's also a removable
SD card and it's also waterproof. If you
ever wanted to start vlogging but you
held back because you thought your life
wasn't interesting enough, think again.
With the Insta 360 Go Ultra, even the
simplest moments can turn into something
really special. This camera lets you
capture your life through unique POV
angles and tell stories in a way that
feels creative, personal, and
effortless. If you're interested in the
Go Ultra, they have a Valentine's Day

make a egg toast using cabbage and
carrots and some onions. And I'm also
watching Can This Love Be Translated.
Such a cute job.
The locations that they're shooting at
is so beautiful.
And that's our egg toast.
Today we're going to go to the car
dealership. My parents will be coming
back and forth from New York and Korea
and they'll be staying for like more
extended amount of time. And when it's
like a packed car with all adults, it's
a little tight. That's me being like
nitpicky. I think at the time when we
purchased the car, we bought it used and
we got a really great deal on it. Me and
Blair Osman are very new to this like
old car thing. We didn't look into
getting auto insurance prior to
purchasing the car. And basically, I
think because I'm a new driver, my rates
were just so high. The car has paid off.
We just have a ridiculously high
insurance rate. I think right now at
this point in my life, I don't really
care to have a fancy car. This is like a
learning lesson for me. I just don't
think it was a very smart decision.
Right now, I value a car that's just
reliable, something that's spacious. Is
this me adulting? I think we all make
good and bad decisions and I think this
was probably one of those decisions that
I should have done some more research.
The minivan is looking so appealing to
me when I was in Japan and a few times
when I was in Korea. I rode around in a
minivan and it was so comfortable. It
felt so luxurious to be able to like
recline in the back seat. I want to go
check it out in person, test drive it. I
think it'll be comfortable for when we
need to drive around our our parents.
We're going to go to Toyota to check out
some of their SUVs, but mainly I'm
really interested in the Kia Carnival. I
was watching a bunch of reviews. They
looked really comfortable. I love the
sliding doors. I love the reclining
chairs. It literally feels like you're
in like a business class flight. Let's
go check it out.
I love how there's more space in the
back.
This is so big. There's no way I can
drive this.
Ooh, I love the quilted seats.
Wow.
This one doesn't have a third row, but
I like this. Oh, wow. I love the seats.
I love the brown seats on these.
Oh, this is nice.
We're here now at Kia.
This is the Talib ride.
What's this one?
That's one for the
It has way more trunk space.
We just show you something so you guys
are aware, right?
This is so cool.
Got the sliding doors.
W I love this car.
I think this is the car for me.
No, I love this.
I'm
custom.
It's so cute. Oh,
so cute.
That's nice. Thank you.
The dress code is neutrals with a hint
of blue, but I don't have any blues. I'm
going to try to use blue on my eyes,
which I've never done any look like
this, so I'm a little nervous,
especially because I am in a rush. I'm
trying to do a bold look that I've never
done before.
It's metallic.
The way to dinner right now. I am eating
at
I'm so hungry. I brought my glasses to
hide the patchiness
of my eye makeup.
Cats woman.
We're making keychains.
